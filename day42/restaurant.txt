    Reservation
        How will you show the resources available?
        Reservation:
            Prereq: None
            Steps:
                - Display a calendar with open times, with the number of open tables per day
                - Once a user selects a time, they can select an available table
                - A user selects an available table and the UI requests some information:
                - Required information includes: name, size of group, contact information.
                - UI will verify the size of the group against the size of the table.
            Alternate Step:
                - No more tables -- Show the soonest available date with open tables.
                - Closed -- Provide open hours information.
                - If the group size is larger than the table size -- The UI does not allow reservations
                    for groups larger than the table size, and suggests an alternate table. If an alternate
                    table does not exist, it suggests to call the restaurant directly for more assistance.
            Post Conditions:
                - The table is registered for the reserved time and other future users will see this
                    table as taken (greyed out) and not be able to reserve the table for that day/time.
